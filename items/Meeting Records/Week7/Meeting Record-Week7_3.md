### Minutes

#### Jing Li

- Continue building the basic framework of the app.
- Considering potential design patterns and data structures to implement.
- Half finished the Btree structure, add some test of the Btree.
- Continue working on the data load flow and synchronization of the firebase database

#### Jiawei Liu

- Today, I studied the board feature in GitLab and looked into some implementation examples of search functionality for learning purposes.

#### Jiawei Ye

- After a comprehensive review of Firebase's official documentation and related resources today, I garnered a deeper understanding of its data import mechanisms. Leveraging this knowledge, I successfully integrated a mock JSON file into the Firebase platform, validating its compatibility and ensuring data integrity.

#### Jun Zhu

- Today, I focused on the [Search] feature. Designed a preliminary UI and began the integration of a tokenizer, laying out the foundation for a parser based on a custom grammar. The distinction for criteria like #apple and $1-2 is still in the planning phase. Encountered some challenges, especially around grammar rule definitions. Tomorrow's goal is to further develop the tokenizer and start on the parser's basic structure.

### Next Steps

- Finalize the data structure for the APP.
- Construct the data flow and tokenizer & parser and the grammar.
- Regular updates on Jira Kanban to track progress.

### Closing

- The team is making steady progress, with members focusing on different aspects of the project.
- The next meeting will focus on consolidating the knowledge acquired and planning the next steps in the development process.
